#FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS

##AI
After getting the onboarding and matchup functionality working optimally, I plan on incorporating more variety in the games. Thoughts include:

    * FOULS
    * INJURIES
    * STRATEGIES (BIG/SMALL)

##COACHING SELECTION PRE GAME
The current program is teseting a lot of functionality with getting players and teams acquired and organized for every matchup. In the future I would like to set up programing to allow the user to hand pick some players or one player to build a team around.

#BUGS

##Duplicate Players
Duplicate players being selected at random during team creation.
